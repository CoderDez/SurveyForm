# SurveyForm
Survey Form built for pretend company 'Slattery's Caf√©.

# Description
The project is a web page containing a survey form built using pure HTML and CSS.
I built this project to put my HTML & CSS skills into practice. The result is a fully dynamic web page that uses no CSS media queries and utilizes CSS flexbox as well as some psuedo selectors to make the styling extra pretty.
